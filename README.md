# thesis-intrinsic-dimension
In this project, I reproduced some of the results of the paper ["Measuring the Intrinsic Dimension of Objective Landscapes"](https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryup8-WCW).

Originally, this was planned to be the starting point for my thesis project for the AI master's degree at the University of Amsterdam, until I switched to [proving a Wigner-Eckart theorem for group equivariant convolution kernels](https://openreview.net/forum?id=ajOrOhQOsYx).
